# London Bicycle Usage Database & Dashboard

This is a project using GCP. 

The aim is to provide an overview of bicycle use in Greater London.

We will do this by calling from the Transport for London API.

We will also collect weather data and attempt to do some basic predictions of upcoming bicycle usage by training an ML model on collected data.

This will all be displayed on a dashboard.
